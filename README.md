# Simple e-store application

This is the "naive" version of a very simple e-store application using three microservices communicating with each others

The purpose is to show how we can evolve such an application to a more elegant one by applying all needed **Cloud Native Patterns**

## Quickstart

````bash
mvn clean compile jib:build

````
